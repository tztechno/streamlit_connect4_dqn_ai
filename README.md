The standard model was prepared by 1 million episodes.

This model is almost genius.

Here's a summary of the changes I made to the Connect4 Streamlit app:

1. **Model Naming with Training Iterations**:
   - Modified the `save_model` function to save models with training count in the filename (e.g., `connect4_model_1000.pth`)
   - Added periodic model saving during training (every 1000 episodes)
   - When training completes, it saves the final model with the total episode count

2. **Game Mode Selection**:
   - Added a radio button in the sidebar to select game modes:
     - Human vs AI (Human goes first)
     - AI vs Human (AI goes first)
     - AI vs AI (Both players are AI)

3. **AI Model Selection**:
   - Added dropdowns to select different AI models for each player
   - The app scans the models directory to find available trained models
   - Different models can be loaded for each AI in AI vs AI mode

4. **Board Interface Improvements**:
   - Added column numbers (0-6) below the board for easier selection
   - Made the human player's move buttons more compact
   - Fixed the design to properly show a 6-row by 7-column board

5. **Bug Fix: Human Winning Move Issue**:
   - Fixed the issue where human players couldn't make a winning move on first attempt
   - Corrected the flow of the game state updates to ensure proper move handling

6. **Code Structure Improvements**:
   - Refactored the AI move function to accept an AI instance parameter
   - Improved the game reset function to handle different game modes
   - Added better error handling for model loading

The app now offers more flexibility in gameplay options and addresses all the requested modifications. The interface is more intuitive with the game mode selection on the left and a cleaner board display.
